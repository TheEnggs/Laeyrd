## ✨ What Is Laeyrd?

**Laeyrd** gives you complete control over your Visual Studio Code’s **appearance and behavior** — without ever touching a JSON file.

It’s a one-stop extension that lets you:

- 🎨 **Design custom themes** directly inside VS Code.
- ⚙️ **Tweak editor settings** with a clean visual interface.
- ☁️ **Sync your setup** using your GitHub account.

Laeyrd turns theme editing and configuration into something actually fun.
